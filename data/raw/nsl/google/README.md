# Google NSL data

This data is reported in a table on the bottom of [the Google transparency report website](https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/us-national-security?hl=en).

The archive contains NSL letter metadata in CSV format, however, is missing the links to the NSL letters themselves.

We used [this script in the analysis folder](/scripts/analysis/parse_and_download_google_nsls.ipynb) to download the NSLs in this folder.
